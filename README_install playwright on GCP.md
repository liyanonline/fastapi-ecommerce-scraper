install playwright on GCP

Steps to Install Playwright on GCP (e.g., Cloud Shell or Compute Engine VM)
1. Set Up Your GCP Environment
Cloud Shell: If you’re using GCP Cloud Shell (as in liyanonlineca@cloudshell:~/mywork/myscraper), it’s a temporary Debian-based VM with Python pre-installed. You can proceed directly.
Compute Engine VM: If you’re using a VM, create one with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Playwright’s recommended OS):
Go to GCP Console > Compute Engine > VM Instances > Create Instance.
Choose “Ubuntu 22.04 LTS” (x86/64), e2-medium (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM) for basic use, and at least 10 GB storage.
SSH into the VM after creation.
2. Update the System
Ensure the system is up-to-date to avoid dependency issues:
bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
3. Install Python and pip (if needed)
Cloud Shell typically has Python 3 and pip installed. Verify with:
bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
If missing on a VM, install them:
bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
4. Install Playwright for Python
Install the Playwright Python package via pip:
bash
# pip3 install playwright
This installs the Python library but not the browser binaries yet.
5. Install Playwright Browser Binaries
Playwright requires browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). Install them with:
bash
# python3 -m playwright install
This downloads the browsers to ~/.cache/ms-playwright/ by default. On GCP Cloud Shell, this works fine since you have write access to your home directory.
6. Install System Dependencies
Playwright needs additional system libraries for the browsers to run (e.g., for Chromium’s headless mode). Install them:
bash
# python3 -m playwright install-deps
This installs packages like libnss3, libatk1.0-0, etc., required on Debian/Ubuntu systems like Cloud Shell or your VM.
7. Verify Installation
Test Playwright with a simple script. Create a file, e.g., test_playwright.py:
python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    print(page.title())
    browser.close()
Run it:
bash
python3 test_playwright.py
If it prints “Example Domain,” Playwright is working.
8. (Optional) Use in Your Project
If this is for your products_webscrap.py (which had the sklearn error), add Playwright imports and logic as needed. For example, replace Selenium with Playwright for scraping:
python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def scrape_data(url):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto(url)
        products = page.query_selector_all(".product-title")  # Adjust selector
        prices = page.query_selector_all(".price")  # Adjust selector
        data = {
            "Product": [p.inner_text() for p in products],
            "Price": [float(p.inner_text().replace("$", "")) for p in prices]
        }
        browser.close()
        return pd.DataFrame(data)
9. (Optional) Deploy with Gradio to Hugging Face Spaces
If integrating with your Gradio app, update requirements.txt:
gradio
selenium
pandas
openpyxl
matplotlib
webdriver-manager
scikit-learn
playwright
Run gradio deploy from your project directory (~/mywork/myscraper or C:\Users\yan\mywork\github\product-web-scraper) after activating your virtual environment and ensuring Playwright is installed.
Notes for GCP-Specific Considerations
Cloud Shell: Storage is temporary; re-run python3 -m playwright install if your session resets. For persistence, use a VM or Cloud Storage.
Compute Engine: Ensure the VM has enough memory (at least 4 GB) and disk space (10 GB+) for browser binaries.
Headless Mode: Playwright runs headless by default, which is ideal for GCP’s server environments. If you need headed mode, you’d need a display server (e.g., Xvfb), but that’s rare for cloud use.
Permissions: No sudo is needed in Cloud Shell for pip installs, but on a VM, use sudo for system-wide changes.
Troubleshooting
Error: “Executable doesn’t exist”: Re-run python3 -m playwright install to ensure browsers are downloaded.
Dependency Conflicts: If you hit conflicts (like with numpy or tensorflow), use a virtual environment:
bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install playwright
python3 -m playwright install
GCP Service: If you meant Cloud Functions or Cloud Run, Playwright is trickier due to size limits and runtime constraints. Let me know, and I’ll provide a tailored solution (e.g., using a custom Docker image).
Let me know if you need help with a specific GCP service or integrating this with your existing code!
